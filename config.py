# 'init': The application will liquidate any existing positions for the HEDGING_ASSET
#         and its options, then establish a new straddle to start fresh.

# --- Hedging Strategy Parameters ---
# The 'dead band' for our portfolio's net delta. A hedge trade is triggered
# if the absolute value of the net delta exceeds this threshold. A larger value
# means fewer, larger trades, while a smaller value results in more frequent,
# smaller adjustments. Finding the right balance is key to profitability.
HEDGING_DELTA_THRESHOLD = 1.7  # e.g., re-hedge when delta moves by +/- 2 shares
# The number of straddles (1 call + 1 put) to purchase. This is the primary
# lever for scaling the overall size of the strategy. All subsequent hedge
# trades will be scaled based on this multiplier.

# A weighting factor for theta in the straddle selection score.

# Defines how sensitive the system is to market data for triggering a delta recalculation.

# In a quiet market, a delta recalculation is triggered at this fixed interval.

# processed by the Position Manager within this time frame, it is considered
# stale and discarded. This prevents the execution of outdated trades.
